Project: Take a scrambled Rubik’s cube and effectively solve the cube and show the users the correct steps to transform the cube to a solved state. 

Sprint 1: 9/19 - 10/3 <br/>
Learn tech stack as necessary: python and React.js tutorials  <br/>
Understand generally how a Rubik’s cube is solved <br/> 
Research Rubik’s cube solving algorithms and decide on one to implement <br/>
Research machine learning and reinforcement learning <br/>
Set up environment <br/>

Sprint 2: 10/3 - 10/17 <br/>
Determine how to input/orient data to represent rubik’s cube <br/>
Front end: Display Rubik’s cube  <br/>
Back end: Start implementing existing algorithm: solve white side <br/>

Sprint 3: 10/17 - 10/31 (Midterm Presentation: 10/28) <br/>
Front end: Allow user to input rubik’s cube (Maybe look into image recognition) <br/>
Back end: Continue implementing algorithm: complete rest of sides <br/>

Sprint 4: 10/31 - 11/14 <br/>
Front end: Output steps/images to solve cube <br/>
Back end: Finish implementing algorithm if needed, otherwise: try using machine learning to solve cube <br/>

Sprint 5: 11/14 - 12/8 (Final Video Deadline: 12/8) <br/>
Front end: Polish up front end tutorial <br/>
Back end: Continue to use machine learning to solve cube <br/>
